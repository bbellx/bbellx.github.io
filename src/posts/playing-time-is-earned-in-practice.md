I've played soccer ever since I can remember. I love the camaraderie of a team, the exercise keeps me healthy, the strategy intrigues me and playing a sport gives me purpose and focus.

*Wait, you're not going to talk about how good you are?*

No.

Actually...I will. I'm not very good.

Sure I can make runs, look the part on the field, even ball-handle fairly well. But I'm not a technical player nor am I quick enough to excel at the sport. I knew this early on, but I kept playing anyway. Skill didn't really matter as a kid.

In college, my coach would always say that playing time is earned in practice. He'd bark it as we ran drills. I thought, "That's cool, I can work hard." What he didn't say, though, was that earning playing time (at the collegiate level) was also predicated on being a talented player. It's a competitive sport and we weren't playing for juice boxes and orange slices anymore.

Game day. I loved game day. I wanted to be on the field, in the game, playing with my teammates. It's exciting to be a part of something bigger. It feels great when your team wins. And, it's humbling and motivating when you don't.

The problem was I found myself practicing hard day in and day out thinking I would eventually earn playing time, but I'd sit on the bench come game day — super limber though, stretching is key.

So, you've all seen the classic 1995 movie, [The Big Green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBOsdyx6V6M) right? Perhaps not, but there is a scene in that movie where a kid does a flip throw. Don't know what that is? Well, this is the least dorky YouTube video I could find [demonstrating the move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5B9XSVdP6OY&feature=youtu.be&t=30). The first time I saw that scene I just had to learn how to do it. I think I was 12, and I learned how to do a flip throw — you know, back when it's kind of cute to make yourself look like an even bigger dork playing the grass fairy sport.

Anyway, back to college. I wanted playing time and I wasn't going to get it through raw, technical soccer talent. I brought back the flip.

After some stretching — seriously, gotta stay limber — and a couple practice handsprings that solicited some weird looks, I threw the ball from half field straight into the goal box where my teammate headed the ball into the upper corner of the goal.

I earned playing time.

In software development, we spend a lot of time practicing the fundamentals of programming. We've learned the technical skills. And those skills have earned us playing time on *this* team. And you know what? We keep showing up because we love our sport.

We have drive, creative minds and amazing problem solving skills. We're nerds. Our skills are stretched everyday — nerd brains are always limber.

So continue to hone your raw engineering talent. And, if there is a skill you just know is not in your wheelhouse, find another way to continue to earn playing time on the projects you love. Learn to do something unconventional. Bring something to the table that only you can, even if it raises a few eyebrows.

It's your ability to work harder, dig deeper, and solve more complex problems than anyone else that causes our clients to say, "I need those Nerds on my team. I want them in the game — they've earned it."
